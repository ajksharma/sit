This means that it will include records with invalid
hashes into its consideration. Kind of defeating the point
of this feature. The reason why this is so is performance.

However, I think this is a bad idea as it promotes an
unhealthy balance between performance and integrity.

Solution: enable integrity checking by default
but enable turning it off both from the API and
command line (`-i/--disable-integrity-check).

Also, by providing an additional `sit integrity`
command, we can enable users to verify their repositories
and get a report on records violating the integrity check.

If one wants to optimize certain scripts, initial `sit integrity`
command can be used to check the repository's current status and
the follow-up integrity checks in other commands can be further
disabled by defining the `SIT_DISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECK` environment
variable.
