Tests pertaining to duplicate name fail in debug mode on aarch64,
the OS error is never returned.

Solution: work around the problem specifically for this environment

This patch will ensure that the existence of the directory is
checked on aarch64 in debug mode. It is not perfect, however,
because there's still a gap between the check and the attempt to
create the directory (however small it might be to a human eye)
