Josh, thank you for providing your feedback.

Let me split this into two parts.

You mentioned you weren't able to get the shortcut
(named filters/queries) functionality working. Can
you please elaborate on that?

Now, the user experience. Let me explain further
what drove my thinking process. Firstly, I am still
fairly confident that once any actual UI is released
(be it web, GUI, or TUI), that'll be the primary
interface for the vast majority of users, including
myself (it'll be just so much more convenient and
less error-prone). Secondly, the problem I personally
see with finding a reasonable "default rendering"
is that it is hard to find a common ground. Should
it be "id + summary"? Should it filter out closed issues?
The rabbit hole is deep, and I'd rather let the users
choose what they want to see by typing in something like
`sit issues -F open -Q overview` and let them choose
their own shell abbreviatons/aliases for most common
cases (the above could be `sioo` for all I know).
