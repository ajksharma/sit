As someone rightfully [mentioned on
reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/7xwvag/sit_scmagnostic_offlinefirst_issue_tracker/dubvl5j/),
too many files are hiding as dot-files.

The idea behind dot-files is that they are "meta" -- i.e.
about the item where they are, but not the item itself.

For some things it makes sense (like `.issues` is meta to `issues`),
but for `.reducers` and `.web` this doesn't really hold true.

Solution: move .reducers to reducers and .web to web

This is a breaking change.
