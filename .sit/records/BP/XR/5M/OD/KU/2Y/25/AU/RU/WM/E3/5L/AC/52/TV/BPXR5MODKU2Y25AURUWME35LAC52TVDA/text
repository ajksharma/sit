Currently, if I want to leave a comment during a merge process, I'd have
to create a separate commit for this comment, which is really suboptimal
experience.

Solution: make merge-merge-request accept comment as an optional
argument.

If a longer comment is desired, one can start with a simple comment in
the command line and then expand on it the editor.
