Since sit-web allows creating issues and records,
exposing that without integrating these records with
actual user identity is pointless.

However, it would have been nice to refer to issues
hosted online (in an absence of autenticating and
user-separating version of sit-web).

Solution: designate a read-only mode for sit-web

Under this mode, it will not allow creating anything
and will also expose the fact of it being read-only
to the frontend.

This patch also makes UI take that into an account
and removes composing/editing UI based on this setting.
