This means they can't verify the "legitimacy" of the record, which might be particularly
important when updating the issue (say, `SummaryChanged` or `DetailsChanged`)

Proposed solution: expose `verified()` function to the `state`/`record` argument of the
reducer function that will do the verification on demand and (if possible) return the
signing key information.
