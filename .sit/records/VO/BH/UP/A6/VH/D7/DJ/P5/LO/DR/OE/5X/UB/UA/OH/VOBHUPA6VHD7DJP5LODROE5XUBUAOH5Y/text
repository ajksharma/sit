SIT supports external commands (in a way similar to git), where if it
can't find an embedded subcommand, it will try to invoke sit-<command>
with the rest of the arguments.

However, this means that these commands have to be in PATH which means
that every user has to perform certain installation procedures (either
locally or globally).

This reduces the usability and appeal of this feature.

Solution: make `sit` look into `cli` directory in the repository
as well to try discover these scripts or binaries (scripts are highly
recommended, though, to preserve multiplatformness).

On Windows, this means it has to be a .bat file.

In addition, this feature will include `SIT_DIR` (pointing to the
repository) and `SIT` (pointing to the currently executed binary of
`sit`) variables to make development of such scripts a little bit
easier.
