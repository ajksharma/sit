The error is:

"The procedure entry point GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime could not be
located in the dynamic link library KERNEL32.dll"

Solution: avoid using this function in Duktape if compiled with
`windows7` feature

This function has only been added in Windows 8

This is a provisional merge request as I can't verify
it on Windows 7. Waiting for the original issue report
