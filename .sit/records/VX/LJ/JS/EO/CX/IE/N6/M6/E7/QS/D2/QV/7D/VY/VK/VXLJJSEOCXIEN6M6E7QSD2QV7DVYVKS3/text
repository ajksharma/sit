Thanks, that's a pretty ingenious way to capture fairly
accurate information!

A thought: currently, it'll try to derive this information
either from working directory (which is usually current
working directory) or a global git config.

However, the user might be not in the root of their
git repo but somewhere a level or few below.

So, how'd we figure this out? We can re-use the algorithm
in `Repository::find_in_or_above` -- either essentially
copy paste it, or extract a generalization.

This way even if the user is not in the root of their project,
sit will still be able to start without having to configure
sit first.
