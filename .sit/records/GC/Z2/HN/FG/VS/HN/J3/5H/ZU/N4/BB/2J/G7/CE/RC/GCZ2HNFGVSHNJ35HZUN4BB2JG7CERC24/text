On systems without explicitly SIT configuration
or gitconfig for deriving this information,
calling `sit record` results in an error:

```
SIT needs your authorship identity to be configured (supported sources:
sit, git), or re-run this command in a terminal
...
thread '<test name>' panicked at 'expected command to succeed, got
ExitStatus(ExitStatus(256))',
```

Solution: disable authorship collection in those tests
