These configs are less accessible to shell scripts
which might want to read some of the repository's
configuration (they'd need support of external
tooling like `jq`)

Solution: switch from JSON to a plain text, file-based
configuration format (serde_fs)

This patch also enables smooth upgrade path upon confirmation
(this feature is gated and can be removed by disabling
`deprecated-config-json` feature in sit-core)

At this moment, we are not dealing with user configs as
it is not clear whether it would be a beneficial change
or not.
