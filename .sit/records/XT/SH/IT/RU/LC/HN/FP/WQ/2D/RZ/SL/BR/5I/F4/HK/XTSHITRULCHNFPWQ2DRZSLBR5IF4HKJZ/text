Currently, sit (as a CLI tool) requires at least .type files to
be specified either through -t argument or .type/... files.

This requirement comes from an earlier time when it was assumed
that every record must have a type. That made sense with issue tracking
and the way it was implemented.

However, this may become a hindrance in other modules as they would
have to comply with this requirement for no good reason.

Solution: remove the requirement to have at least one type specified
