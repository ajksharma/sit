This is not a typical workflow (git, for example,
will try to figure out user's name and email) and
might be a little bit of an adoption barrier.

Perhaps, we can do the same thing as git, or,
considering that git [never] can figure out
email correctly, maybe it is better to force
users to do this manually?
