Solution: reorganize some written materials

* Documentation is reorginzed in more logical order: `Repository -> Issue -> Record -> Reducers`
* Issue-related materials are grouped as an sub-entries in Issue section
* Emphasize that title and description should be added to the temporary `text` file step by step
* Typo is fixed in CONTRIBUTING.md
* Added angular brackets to clarify that `BRANCH` should be substituted CONTRIBUTING.md

This is not perfect in two respects:

* Initial illustration is still intimidating and is more related to developers
  than to the users, but I can't think of a better place for it.

* Subsections in Issues are also related to contributing, since are build up on
  SIT-specific process but I don't think that it's a problem since they
  encourage good practices and can be a good default for a lot of projects out
  there.
