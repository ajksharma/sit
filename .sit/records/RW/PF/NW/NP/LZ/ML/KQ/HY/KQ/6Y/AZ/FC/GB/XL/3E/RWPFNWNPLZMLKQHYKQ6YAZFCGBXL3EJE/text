Currently, `sit` would try to derive or ask for authorship
information upon any launch, whether it is really needed
or not (this information is only needed for `sit record`
to function).

While this is a minor annoyance, this also becomes an issue
for test as they would have to handle this as if there's
no .gitconfig to derive authorship from, the process tested
will hang up because it'll be waiting for the user to enter
their authorship information in the terminal interactively.

Solution: only figure out authorship information when needed
