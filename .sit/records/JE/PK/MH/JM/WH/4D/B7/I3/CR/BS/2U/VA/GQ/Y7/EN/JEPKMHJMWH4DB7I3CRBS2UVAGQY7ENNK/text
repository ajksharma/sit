When using scripts/prepare-merge-request on branches
that have more than one commit, the pre-defined issue
details will dump git log in a descending order (last
commit first). This order makes a lot of sense
when viewing history but makes much less sense when
describing what changed (as it doesn't look "step-by-step"
anymore)

Solution: use `git log --reverse` to reverse the order
