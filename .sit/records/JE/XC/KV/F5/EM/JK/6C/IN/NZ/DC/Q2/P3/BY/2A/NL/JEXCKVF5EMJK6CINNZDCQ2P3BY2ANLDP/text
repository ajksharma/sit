For every change to be made, a symlink to a file
or to a containing directory must be made and
subsequently removed to avoid the clutter.

Solution: add `-o/--overlay` argument to
sit-web so that its actual source code can
be used as an overlay.

This feature will also enable other sit-web
users to introduce multiple overlays to enable
"mixin" overlays to enable or disable certain
features.
