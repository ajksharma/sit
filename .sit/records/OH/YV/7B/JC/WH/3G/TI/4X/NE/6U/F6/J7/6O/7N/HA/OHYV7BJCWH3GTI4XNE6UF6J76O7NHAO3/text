valgrind shows that it takes up to 10% of the time in my use
cases.

Solution: switch to listing the directory and comparing the extensions
instead.

This is a slightly breaking behaviour: it will no longer pick up
.js files that are not directly under `reducers`. This might be a
longer-term benefit if we enable modules to be loaded, then we
don't want all files to be picked up automatically.
