Problem: SIT leaves some temp directories

Even though TempDirs are supposed to be deleted upon their dropping
(https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/tempdir/blob/master/src/lib.rs#L349-L356),
I can still observe .sit/sit.* temp directories appearing.

(The reason they are in .sit is to ensure they are at the same mount
point as the SIT repository they are intended for, to enable atomic
renames)

Solution: where easily possible, ensure clean exit is performed

``std::process:exit`` terminates the program immediately,
not giving the destructors to have a chance to do anything.
