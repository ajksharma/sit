Keeps failing "couldn't read e:\...\...\" errors

Solution: use a fork of include_dir

The problem was there because backslashes are not escaped
properly in upstream include_dir.

The fork uses raw strings and therefore prevents the issue.

Problem: test fails on Windows

This is because creating path in it uses a hard-coded forward slash.

Solution: use platform-indepenent `Path#join()`
instead to avoid the issue altogether.
