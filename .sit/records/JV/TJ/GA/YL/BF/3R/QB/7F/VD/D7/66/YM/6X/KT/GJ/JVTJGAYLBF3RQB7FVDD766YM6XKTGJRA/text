While SIT is narrowly focused on issue tracking, the concept and
primitives are actually useful for building other types of information
trackers (annotations, accounting, knowledge management, etc).

Solution: rename issues to items

As a first step towards enabling and encouraging other uses of SIT,
rename issues to items.

By itself, this change doesn't warrant updating marketing materials
and documentation yet, but it is an important stepping stone.

It is expected that modularizing reducers, web overlays and other
similar components will allow us to complete basic transition from
Issue Tracking to generalized Information Tracking.
