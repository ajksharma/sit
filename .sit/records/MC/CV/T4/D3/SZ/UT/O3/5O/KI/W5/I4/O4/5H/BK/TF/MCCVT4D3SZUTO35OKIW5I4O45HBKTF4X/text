sit-web crashes a responding thread on just about any error
(resulting in HTTP 500).

In some cases this is fine (something truly unexpected happened,
especially I/O-wise), but often times it is not, in cases such as:

* Issue not found
* Invalid JMESPath expression

and so on.

Proposed solution: return such errors to the client
