Currently, if one person updates an item with, say, `SummaryChanged` or
`DetailsChanged`, anybody else can create follow-up records of the same type
and override the values originally submitted, even if they were not intended to
be authorized to do so.

Proposed solution: introduce a permissioning system based
on allowing certain keys to sign updates, and, perhaps, introduce
some kind of groups to the repository to be able to refer
to sets of keys instead of specific keys. This is going
to be quite a big feature.
