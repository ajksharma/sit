Currently, if the commands do anything complicated with
JSON (processing reducers' output, managing sit config file),
they'd most likely require external tooling like jq.

Not only this is introducing a dependency, it's also inconsistent
with SIT's use of JMESPath.

Solution: introduce a `jmespath` subcommand

This command provides access to the JMESPath functionality
from external tools.
