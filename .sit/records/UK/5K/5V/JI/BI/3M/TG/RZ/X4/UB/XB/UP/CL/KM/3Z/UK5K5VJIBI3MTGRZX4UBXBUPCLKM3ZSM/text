Overall this patch works, *however*, it seems to trigger
the intermittent problem of "can't connect to gpg-agent"
in tests on OS X in almost 100% of runs (can't reproduce
this on Linux or Windows)

In the ideal world, this whole gpg-agent connection issue
should be solved separately as it does occur on other platforms,
just not as often -- in just about all tests that use `gpg`
