Even though `TempDir`s are supposed to be deleted upon their dropping (https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/tempdir/blob/master/src/lib.rs#L349-L356),
I can still observe `.sit/sit.*` temp directories appearing.

(The reason they are in `.sit` is to ensure they are at the same mount point as the SIT repository they are intended for, to enable atomic renames)

Proposed solution: find and eliminate the source of this leak.
