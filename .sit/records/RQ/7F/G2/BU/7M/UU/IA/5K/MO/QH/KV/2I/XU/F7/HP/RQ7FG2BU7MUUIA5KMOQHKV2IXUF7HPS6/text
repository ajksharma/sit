If one was to pass a filename like "../filename" or "/tmp/something",
sit-core would try to oblige.

What's even worse, it hashes these relative paths as names
so even if these relative paths resolve back into the record,
the hash upon checking will not match.

This is a pretty big deal. While I believe `sit` binary kind of
prevents this scenario by having its own checks, this exposes
sit-core as a library to this vulnerability.

Solution: make `OrderedFiles` normalize filenames
and `new_record_in` in Repository reject files that are not
contained inside of the record.
