This can lead to problems with broken behaviour.

Solution: cover it with basic integration tests

While working on it, I've noticed that there's
no interaction between working directory and a
repository (if both are supplied). This means
that if both are, repository's path will be used
relative to the current directory of the process,
effectively ignoring supplied working directory.

To address this, if both are supplied, they will
be concatenated. This means that if, for example,
repository path is relative, it'll be relative
to the supplied working directory. If it is absolute,
it'll be effectively used as is.
