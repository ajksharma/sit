Attached is an alternative solution for the original problem,
perhaps a less intrusive one (however, serde_fs is a cool, too,
if only a bit immature). Most importantly, it doesn't
require a change of the config format.

Ultimately, these two solutions are independent and both can
be merged, but this kind of decision should be rather motivated :)

Solution: implement `sit config` command

This command will print a user or a repository config and, most
importantly, will take a `-q/--query` argument to process the config
so that these shell script can get the information they require
without external tooling (besides SIT, which one would assume
this scripts will require anyway)
