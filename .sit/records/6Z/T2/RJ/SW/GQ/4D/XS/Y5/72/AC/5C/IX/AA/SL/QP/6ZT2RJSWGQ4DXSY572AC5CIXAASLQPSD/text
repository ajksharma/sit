This happens in cases like current implementation of
signing, where a record directory is renamed in-place
after the content has been signed.

However, if any other process is attempting to add
another record exactly at the same time, they chance
getting a wrong parent record's hash, making it
unresolvable.

Solution: allow explicit locking of an issue
especially where it is known that such things might happen.
