If, instead of running `cargo build` in the project root, one
would attempt to run it in `sit-web/`, the build will fail with
the following error:

```
error[E0599]: no function or associated item named `from_gitconfig` found for type `sit_core::cfg::Author` in the current scope
```

Solution: add `git` feature to `sit-core` dependency in sit-web
