While it's not terribly bad, it's not perfect.

Solution: don't clone DuktapeReducer unnecessarily

Previously, DuktapeReducer was cloned for every
item to be reduced. This is quite wasteful as every
clone operation has a non-zero cost.

However, when we're using Rayon, there's a limited
number of workers reducing items, so we can actually
clone enough of DuktapeReducers for every worker,
and simply reset each one of them (this is cheaper)
for every item reduction.

In a non-scientific test, reducing ~4,000 items went
from about 15 or so seconds to about 12 or so. That's
a 20% improvement.
