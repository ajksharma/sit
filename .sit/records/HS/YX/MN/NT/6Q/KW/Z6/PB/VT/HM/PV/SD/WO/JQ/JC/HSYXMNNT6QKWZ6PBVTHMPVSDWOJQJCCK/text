When I am doing a lot of maintenance work (i.e. merging
merge requests), it's annoying that I have to go to the URL,
copy the ID part, then find the hash of the merge request
record, copy that just to run `merge-merge-requests`.

Solution: provive "Maintainer's tip" with copy-paste information
(and a copy button)

This also showcases how sit-web's UI can be extended
