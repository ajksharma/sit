Problem: sit-web's handling of errors is rudimentary

sit-web crashes a responding thread on just about any error (resulting
in HTTP 500).

In some cases this is fine (something truly unexpected happened,
especially I/O-wise), but often times it is not, in cases such as:

* Issue not found
* Invalid JMESPath expression

Solution: avoid crashing on the above errors

Also, handle some of these errors in the UI
