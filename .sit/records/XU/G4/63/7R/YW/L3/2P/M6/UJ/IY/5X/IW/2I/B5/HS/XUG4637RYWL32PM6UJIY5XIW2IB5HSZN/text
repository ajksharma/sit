This is a great question. I actually was planning
to use TOML originally.

However, upon further consideration, I decided to
use JSON.

My main reasoning is that JSON definitely has made
a significant dent in the history of programming and
in that sense it is more likely to be future-proof, 
be immediately understandable to a vast majority of
programmers and have parses made for almost all
programming languages.

TOML is nicer but it is relatively unknown.

Considering that one of SIT's goals is to preserve
the history of these records for as long as possible,
I felt like choosing something as ubiquitous as
JSON was the right step, whether I like it or not.

Thoughts, counterarguments?
