Recently, a way to resolve linked paths (`ResolvePath`)
was introduced. However, it is only helpful if the link
is contained only in the last component of the path:

```
$ cat /path/to/link
../something
```

This makes resolving paths that *contain* a link much
more difficult (example: `/path/to/link/some/file`)

Solution: handle this case in `ResolvePath` implementation
and resolve paths that contain links
