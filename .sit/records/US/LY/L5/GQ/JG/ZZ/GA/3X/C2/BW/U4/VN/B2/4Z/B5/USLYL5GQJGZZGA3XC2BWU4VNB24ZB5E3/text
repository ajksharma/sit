In some cases, SIT repository isn't expected to live
alongside some other information. Unlike in the original
case for SIT, where .sit is expected to sit in the root
(and maybe others) directories of a project, there are
cases where SIT repository is *the thing*. For example,
a repository containing accounting information or paper
review system, or anything else.

However, SIT is somewhat adamant about enforcing the .sit
directory convention.

Solution: enhance SIT to recognize current and parent directories
as potential SIT repositories, giving them precendence over
.sit directories.

So, for example, if we're at /path/to/sit/repo/items/xyz/ then
SIT will find /path/to/sit/repo (provided it is a valid repository).

Unlike before, `Repository#find_in_or_above` will now attempt
to open a repository before reporting it found (if it can't open
it, it won't return the path to it)

`sit init` command now takes `--no-dot-sit/-u` argument that would
initialize the repository in the working directory.
