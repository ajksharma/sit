In certain circumstances, repo_init_fail test itself would fail because
the setup won't result in an error.

Solution: make it fail by putting a file in place of expected directory

This approach is more universal across platforms and environments.
For example, previous UNIX setup wouldn't work well if the user had
root privileges (for example, when running in a Docker container).
