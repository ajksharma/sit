With the replacement of GitHub Pull Request
we've [knowingly] lost the automatic testing
of incoming patches (Travis CI and AppVeyor
for Windows). As a side note, nothing hsa changed
for testing the `master` branch.

Still, it's a loss because now the maintainers
are expected to run tests, preferably on all
available platforms, which is less than efficient.
