In some contexts, it might make sense to have multiple types of files in the same repository. Case in point: issue-tracking assumes all items are issues, however, it might make sense to define other entities like "kanban boards" to complement the functionality. Currently all issues in issue-tracking are effectively untyped so reducers don't have an idea that they might be something else.

Proposed solution: allow a repository to have multiple collections. Each collection will have its own reducers but they will share `web`, `cli` and other components. A collection can be defined as `collections/name/items` and `collections/name/reducers`. `items` & `reducers` can perhaps remain the "main" collection so there's nothing to break. Modules would also have to define `collections/name/reducers` if they want to reduce those collections as well. Listing and reducing commands and APIs will have to be able to take collection name (optionally)
