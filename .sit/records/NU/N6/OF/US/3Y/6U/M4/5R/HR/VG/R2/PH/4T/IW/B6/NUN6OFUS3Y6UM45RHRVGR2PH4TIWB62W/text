Currently, the web ui (or any other tooling) should rely on reducers code to figure out what kind of JSON document will they produce.

This is not great because it is error-prone.

Proposed solution: establish JSON schema(s) and declare which reducers produce what so that the tooling that consumes these documents can be reasonably sure about the documents they are receiving and processing.
