Currently, if SIT can't figure out authorship information
from the config file or a Git repository, it'll just abort
and ask the user to edit the config file.

This is clearly an adoption barrier as it requires the user
to figure things out and open an editor.

Solution: if authorship information can't be figured out,
ask the user to enter this information during the same session
and save it to the configuration file.
