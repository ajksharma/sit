If script/prepare-merge-request is called not from master,
the issue branch will created off the current branch, which
might include other things that can't (and shouldn't) be included
and will be ultimately rejected by the inbox hook.

Solution: always branch off master. Keep your master up to date, too
(but I didn't want to fetch it without user's permission)
