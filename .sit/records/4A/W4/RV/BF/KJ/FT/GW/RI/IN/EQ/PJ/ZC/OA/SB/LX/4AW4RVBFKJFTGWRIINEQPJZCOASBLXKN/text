It has been reported that some command line subcommand names are "less than intuitive". For example, `sit issue` creates an issue instead of showing one.

Proposed solution 1: Use `NOUN VERB` or `VERB NOUN` naming scheme (`issue create` or `create issue`)

Proposed solution 2: Use short, but more descriptive names like `sit create` or `sit new`
