With either growing number of issues or introduction
of more complex reducers, the performance starts going
down significantly.

Solution: enable parallel reduction of issues

Since issues are independent trees of records, there's
not much reason to process each issue sequentially.

As a part of this solution, we needed to avoid re-compiling
reducer functions for every individual instance of `DuktapeReducer`
as that is often cost-prohibitive. This is accomplished
by allowing cloning `DuktapeReducer` in which it'll copy
saved bytecode for functions as well as the state these functions
had.
