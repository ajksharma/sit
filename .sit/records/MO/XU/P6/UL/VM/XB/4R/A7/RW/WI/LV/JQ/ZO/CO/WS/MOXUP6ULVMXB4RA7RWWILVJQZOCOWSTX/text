A (potentially simpler) solution might be to develop
a git hook that'll do the same verification and run
it on a gitolite or similar git hosting instance.

This would require updating documentation to show
that issues are sent to another github server.

Once that server is added as a remote, the workflow
is actually going to be better than PR.

With PR, one needs to push the branch, switch to
the browser, go to the repository, click a few times
to get the pull request created.

With this approach, one would just do something like
`git push sit a3df42f7-abe6-42b8-8ec8-1db14d966ad4`
and it's dne.
