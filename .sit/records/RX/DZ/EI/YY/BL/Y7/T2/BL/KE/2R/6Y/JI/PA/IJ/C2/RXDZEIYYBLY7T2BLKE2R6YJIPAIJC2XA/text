This severely limits the ability to customize
the workflows as such reducers would have
to be external.

Proposed solution: consider allowing external
scripts (security risk as it won't be sandboxed)
or a sandbox scripting language of some sort
(I don't like JavaScript but it's the most ubiquitous
language these, and there's V8 -- so maybe JavaScript
and some others later?)
