SIT itself can't tell who created a record and the
only way to retrieve this information is to use
SCM's functionality (such as `git blame`) to figure
that out. That's less than ideal, especially considering
that this information will not surive a loss of an SCM
repository.

Proposed solution: introduce a convention for recording
author's information and make `sit` tool do this by default.
