Firstly, DuktapeReducer is always consumed by
`IssueReduction.reduce_with_reducer` so there's no
chance of re-using it.

Secondly, even if it wasn't, it carries state produced
by individual reducers that should not be carried over
to other (or updated) issues.

Solution: Allow resetting DuktapeReducer's cumulative state
and make `IssueReduction.reduce_with_reducer` take a reference
to a reducer instead of consuming it.
