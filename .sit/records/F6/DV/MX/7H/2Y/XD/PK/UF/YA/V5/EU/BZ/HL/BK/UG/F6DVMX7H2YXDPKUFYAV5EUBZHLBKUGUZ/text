Currently, tools that are not embedded into `sit`
itself have a different invocation convention.

For example, sit's web interface is `sit-web`.
However, embedded subcommands are invoked as `sit record`
(for example).

Solution: implement a scheme similar to git, where an unknown
subcommand is attempted as an external subcommand and if the spawning
is unsuccessful, the subcommand is matched against built-in
commands to see if any suggestion can be produced.

This way, `sit-web` can be invoked as `sit web`.

This change required an upgrade of `clap` to 2.31.2 which enabled
this behaviour.
