Currently, if we wanted to either verify that a certain person made a record,
or even simply allow to make an "authorized" record by the same, or allowed
person (such as allowing a limited number of people to change DetailsChanged,
for example), it would be next to impossible.

Solution: introduce PGP signing of records with GnuPG

This involves specifying a convention for `.signature` and adding relevant
functionality to the command line client.

While on its own this doesn't prevent anything (with regards to permissioning)
this can be utilized by reducers to filter out unsigned/incorrectly signed
records.
