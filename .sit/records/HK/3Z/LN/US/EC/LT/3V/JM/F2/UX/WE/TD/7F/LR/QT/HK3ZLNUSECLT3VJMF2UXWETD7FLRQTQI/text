DuktapeReducer assumes that reducer functions will always return an
object. However, this might not always be true. Because of mistakes or
other reasons, reducers might either return nothing (`undefined`) or
something other than object.

Because of the aforementioned assumption, DuktapeReducer will eventually
produce a fatal error as it requires the state to be an object for
sanity checking.

Solution: handle `undefined` and mistyped cases

In case of `undefined`, ignore the result and re-use the previous state,
however, for mistyped return values, return an error.
