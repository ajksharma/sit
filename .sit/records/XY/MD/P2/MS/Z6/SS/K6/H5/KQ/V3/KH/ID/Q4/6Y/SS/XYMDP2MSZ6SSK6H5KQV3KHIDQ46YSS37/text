When used over a directory, `sit record`
will produce this error:

```
DIRECTORY does not exist or is not a regular file
```

Hence, forcing the user to enter all files in that directory
manually (or using shell's autocompletion)

Proposed solution: treat directories in the least confusing way:
that is, process them recursively, adding all files as if they
were supplied over the command line.
