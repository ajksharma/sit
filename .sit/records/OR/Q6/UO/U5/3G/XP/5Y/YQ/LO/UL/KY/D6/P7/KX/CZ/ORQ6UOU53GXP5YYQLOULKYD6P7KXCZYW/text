Solution: attempt to use gpg2 if available and use --gen-key

The problem was two-fold:

Firstly, on some setups, gpg is gpg 1.x and it does not
understand some options gpg2 does.

Secondly, --generate-key was not universaly understood
by gpg or gpg2, so I settled with --gen-key instead
(which *so far* was seemingly understood universally)
