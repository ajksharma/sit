With the recent introduction of `sit config` subcommand,
it became possible for third-party tools to query information
from repository and user configurations.

However, it is of limited use because this command only gives
access to pre-defined configuration, thus disallowing third-party
tools from using this for carrying and retrieving custom configuration.

A good example of this is being able to store sit-inbox host
and key (if needed) in the configuration so that end-users
won't need to be bothered by this.

Solution: use recently introduced `serde(flatten)` attribute
to allow configuration structures to carry extra configuration.

This way it becomes available to `sit config` and therefore
resolves the problem.
