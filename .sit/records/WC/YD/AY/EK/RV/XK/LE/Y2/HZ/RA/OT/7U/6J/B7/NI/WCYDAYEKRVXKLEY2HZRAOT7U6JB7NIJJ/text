`repository::tests::record_outside_naming_scheme` is failing
with "Access is denied" attempting to do the final `fs::rename`

Solution: ensure no files are open during the move

On Windows, if a file within a directory that is being
moved is open (even for reading), this will prevent
this said directory from being moved, returning "Access
Denied"

Therefore, we have to drop `files` variable to release the `File`
readers that keep files open.
