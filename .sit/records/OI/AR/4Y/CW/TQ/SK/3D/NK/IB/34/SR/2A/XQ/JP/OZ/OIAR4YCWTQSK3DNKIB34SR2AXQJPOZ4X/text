prepare-merge-request script ALWAYS assumes
that the summary of the issue is the subject
of the first commit in the branch (counting
from the forkpoint) and doesn't give any
options there.

It also doesn't provide much in the way of
explanation of what is this file the user
is supposed to edit.

Solution: offer an option to edit summary
and provide instructions/explanation with each file
user is editing
