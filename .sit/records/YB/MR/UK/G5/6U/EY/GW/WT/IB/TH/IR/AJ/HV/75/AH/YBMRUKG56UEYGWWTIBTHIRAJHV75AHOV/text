The error looks like this (during linking):

```

```

This is because Nixpkgs's gcc was always adding -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE which
enables these `*_chk` functions to replace their counterparts. However,
they are not available on musl.

Solution: disable -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE in duktape.c if glibc is not
detected

This is not done as a compile flag because in cases like Nixpkgs the
fortification flag is always added at the end, overriding whatever
might have been passed in build.rs.

This perhaps should be extracted as a patch to duktape (it kind of
makes sense, I suppose?)
