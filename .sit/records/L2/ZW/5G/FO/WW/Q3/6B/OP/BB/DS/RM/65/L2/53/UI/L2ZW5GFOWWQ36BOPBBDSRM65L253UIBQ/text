Currently, scripts/prepare-merge-request will only create a new issue for a merge request. However, this is not always the best way to do this. 

There are a few cases where it would be better to attach MergeRequests to
existing issues:

1. Updates to existing merge request issues.
2. Fixes for a reported bug/issue within that same issue (to avoid having two issues on the same matter)

Proposed solution: let scripts/prepare-merge-request take an optional `issue` argument. If one is supplied, it should record a `Commented,MergeRequested` record for that issue, instead of creating a completely new one.
