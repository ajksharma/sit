It originally was a conversion of "issues" into something that
can be somewhat more generic. However, with further exploration of
different domains it became rather clear that it doesn't fit many of
them well and can only be artifically bolted on. That's not great.

Solution: transition into a flat records namespace

In order to avoid this problem, the idea is to move out all records to
.sit/records into a single flat namespace and make the transition
(almost) seamless by retaining items for a little while but converting
records in them into "text link" files to the real records.
