Currently, unless instructed, `sit` will record some auxiliary
information in every record (specifically, authorship information
and a timestamp). This behaviour can be disabled, however, every
piece of information has to be disabled individually (`--no-author`,
`--no-timestamp`).

However, with SIT's gradual transition to a more generic solution
than it was originally (an issue tracker) this behaviour could be
a nuisance. While in the future it is most likely that by default
`sit` will not record this information and it'll be rather done by
hooks (which haven't been developed yet), the need to pass two
long flags to suppress this information is rather annoying.

Solution: introduce `--no-aux/-n` argument to the `record` subcommand
that will suppress authorship and timestamp information from the record.
