I've noticed that currently used Base32 encoding has padding enabled.
While this is not harmful per se, the non-alphanumeric character of "="
might be problematic on some file systems. Besides, there's no
particular need to pad that I can think of as the size of transported
data is typically known in SIT's context (RFC 4648 3.2)

Solution: switch to non-padded version of Base32

Explicitly stating this is valid under RFC 4648 3.2:

   Implementations MUST include appropriate pad characters at the end of
   encoded data *unless* the specification referring to this document
   explicitly states otherwise.

Luckily for us, we've only used 20-byte long Blake2 and SHA-1 hashing
algorithms so far so SIT has never produced padded record names (that
is, unless somebody used SIT with a manually modified config to state
a different length of the Blake2 algorithm output -- which is highly
unlikely at this stage of SIT's adoption).
